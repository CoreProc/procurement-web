<div ng-controller="LayoutCtrl" layout="column" layout-fill class="layout-content">

  <p>
    The grid system is different than most because of its use of the
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">CSS Flexible Box Layout Module</a> standard. With flexbox
    you have the power to simply add in the columns and rows required, and they'll evenly take up the
    available space of their parent layout container. There's no restriction to a 12 column grid, or
    having to explicitly state how large each column should be.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Flex Attribute</h3>
  <p>
    Child elements of a layout container with the <code>flex</code>
    attribute will "flex", or stretch, to fill the available area within its parent layout container.
    If a design requires three evenly spaced elements, simply add three elements with a
    <code>flex</code> attribute. Elements without the flex attribute will take up their natural size,
    whereas elements with the flex attribute will evenly fill in the available area.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Layout Padding</h3>
  <p>
    This layout has padding, or gutters, between each cell by adding the
    <code>layout-padding</code> attribute. The previous examples added in their own
    margins/padding manually, whereas the layout-padding attribute spaces it all out
    evenly.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Layout Padding with Available Space Percents</h3>
  <p>
    Flex attributes can be given integers to represent the percentage of the available space
    it should take up. Note that elements which are not given a percentage still
    fill up the available area. Adjust the window size to see
    the demo's responsive layout attributes at work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that flex attributes are only defined in increments of 5, with the exception of 
    33 and 66. (ie. <code>flex=5, flex=10, flex=15, ... flex=33, flex=35, ... flex=66, etc</code>) 
    This avoids needlessly including extra css in the framework. If you need more
    specificity than what is provided by our breakpoints, use stylesheets to set the
    <code>flex-basis: x%; max-width: x%;</code> properties.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Layout Padding with Offsets</h3>
  <p>
    Elements can be offset from the left, but still allow the gutters to line up correctly.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Layout Order</h3>
  <p>
    Child elements of a layout container can have their order changed through the use of the
    <code>layout-order</code> attribute, and respective responsive
    attributes such as: layout-order-sm, layout-order-md, and layout-order-lg. Reordering elements
    is useful when the placement of a cell should be changed depending on the viewport size.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the demo, notice how the default size (the smallest) has each of the elements in their
    natural order determined by its markup. However, as the viewport changes size then each
    individual cell can change their order using the layout-order attribute.

  <h3 class="layout-title">Header, Menu, Main, Footer, no padding</h3>
  <p>
    This layout lets each of the header and footer tracks height be the size of their
    respective content, and the middle track (menu and main) flex vertically to fill the
    space of the entire layout. This is also an example of nested layouts, where the entire
    body is a vertical layout (header/content/footer), and the content row is its own layout
    (menu/main), and each layout has their own settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    The body element has the <code>layout="column"</code> attribute.
    By default the middle track has the menu and main elements stacked vertically. However,
    the elements line up horizontally starting at the "small" size, which is determined by the
    media query.
