## 0.9.0 (2014-07-06)

## 0.8.3 (2014-06-14)

[Issue #58]: https://github.com/thephpleague/fractal/issues/58

## 0.8.2 (2014-06-09)

Bug:

  - A `null` value for `Manager::parseIncludes()` could have weird results

## 0.8.1 (2014-06-05)

Features:

  - Make `ResourceAbstract` implement `ResourceInterface`

Bug:

  - Fixed tests for Laravel 4.2 usage


## 0.8.0 (2014-05-27)

Features:

  - Added Serializers with ArraySerializer, DataArraySerializer (default) and a provisional JsonApiSerializer. See [Issue #47]
  - Added `ResourceAbstract::setMeta('foo', mixed)` to allow custom meta data
  - Replaced `Manager::setRequestedScopes()` with `Manager::parseIncludes('foo,bar')` which can be an array or CSV string. It can
  also take "Smart Syntax" such as `Manager::parseIncludes('bars:limit(5|1):order(-something)')`, which can come from a URL query
  param: `/foo?include=bars:limit(5|1):order(-something)`
  - Made all pagination (paginators and cursors) use meta output logic, so it sits with your custom meta data
  - Moved `League\Fractal\Cursor\Cursor` and `League\Fractal\Cursor\CursorInterface` into `League\Fractal\Pagination`
