Fractal provides a presentation and transformation layer for complex data output, the like found in
RESTful APIs, and works really well with JSON. Think of this as a view layer for your JSON/YAML/etc.

When building an API it is common for people to just grab stuff from the database and pass it
to `json_encode()`. This might be passable for "trivial" APIs but if they are in use by the public,
or used by mobile applications then this will quickly lead to inconsistent output.

## Goals

* Create a "barrier" between source data and output, so schema changes do not affect users
* Systematic type-casting of data, to avoid `foreach()`ing through and `(bool)`ing everything
* Include (a.k.a embedding, nesting or side-loading) relationships for complex data structures
* Work with standards like HAL and JSON-API but also allow custom serialization
* Support the pagination of data results, for small and large data sets alike
* Generally ease the subtle complexities of outputting data in a non-trivial API

This package is compliant with [PSR-1], [PSR-2] and [PSR-4]. If you notice compliance oversights,

## Testing

``` bash
$ phpunit
```
